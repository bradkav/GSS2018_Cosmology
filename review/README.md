# GSS2018_Cosmology

## Review

This is the place to put your files for the review, including LaTeX and BibTex. Beyond that, you can use whatever directory structure makes sense to you.

Note that the repository has been initialised with a `.gitignore` file, which means that a number of auxiliary files (`.aux`, `.out`, etc.) generated by LaTex will not be tracked by `git`.

You can also use this README for any notes related to the review and your collaboration (To-Do lists, plans, etc.).
